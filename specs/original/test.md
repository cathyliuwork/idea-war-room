[TEST CASE #1]

We're building a platform that helps indie hackers validate their startup ideas through AI-powered adversarial analysis.

Problem: Founders spend weeks gathering feedback from friends, mentors, and potential customers, only to realize critical flaws too late in the development process Traditional validation methods are time-consuming, biased, and often miss non-obvious failure modes.

Solution: Our AI-powered platform simulates adversarial red team analysis across five threat vectors (technical, market, social, legal, and narrative). Think of it as a "pre-mortem" for your startup idea - we help you identify vulnerabilities before you invest significant time and resources.

Target Users: Solopreneurs and early-stage founders (pre-seed to seed stage) who are still validating their ideas. Typically technical founders who can build quickly but want to derisk their concept before committing.

Competitive Landscape: Existing tools include YC's startup school (educational but not analytical), validation frameworks like Lean Canvas (manual and time-consuming), and paid consultants (expensive and slow). No one offers AI-powered multi-vector threat analysis specifically for startup ideas.

Success Metric (18 months): 10,000 validated startup ideas with 70% accuracy on risk prediction (measured by whether founders who acted on our recommendations avoided predicted failure modes).

Business Model: Freemium model - free basic analysis, $49 for detailed MVTA report with interactive Q&A. Target 5% conversion rate from free to paid.

Key Assumptions:
  - Market: Early-stage founders are willing to pay for AI-powered idea validation
  - Technical: LLMs can accurately simulate adversarial perspectives and identify non-obvious risks
  - Business: We can build enough trust and accuracy to achieve word-of-mouth growth in founder communities

Unique Advantages: Our team has experience building and failing multiple startups, giving us deep domain knowledge of failure modes. We're also using cutting-edge LLM techniques for adversarial analysis thatweren't possible until recently.

[测试用例#2]

我们正在构建一个AI驱动的代码审查助手，专门针对JavaScript/TypeScript项目。

问题：开发者在提交代码前很难发现潜在的安全漏洞、性能问题和代码异味。传统的静态分析工具误报率高，需要大量配置。

解决方案：我们的AI助手能够理解代码上下文，提供智能化的代码审查建议，包括：
  - 安全漏洞检测（SQL注入、XSS等）
  - 性能瓶颈识别
  - 代码可维护性评分
  - 最佳实践推荐

目标用户：中小型软件公司的前端/全栈开发者，团队规模5-50人。

竞争环境：现有工具包括SonarQube、ESLint、但它们都是基于规则的，缺乏上下文理解。

成功指标（18个月）：
  - 1000个付费团队订阅
  - 每个团队月活跃用户达到80%
  - 代码审查时间减少50%
  - 用户报告发现的关键bug数量提升3倍

商业模式：SaaS订阅，$29/用户/月，提供14天免费试用。

关键假设：
  - 市场假设：中小团队愿意为AI代码审查付费
  - 技术假设：LLM能够准确理解代码上下文并给出有价值的建议
  - 业务假设：我们能在6个月内达到产品-市场契合度

独特优势：我们团队有10年的编译器和静态分析经验，已经有一个开源项目积累了5000+ GitHub stars。
